"There are lots of things to be happy about!" as Joy said in Inside Out, especially the projects ALAC has in store for you this year! Projects this year have never been more exciting, and the departments are excited to show them to you! They gave a short sneak peek at how our projects are gonna be like. It was all fun, games, and dancing on Iridescence: The First General Assembly, last September 7, 2015 at the Faura AVR !
