Think about a trip or an experience of other cultures and traditions without leaving the country. Sounds impossible right? WRONG! Out of the hustle and bustle of school life, ALAC went out and made it possible for our ALACholics to experience other cultures and traditions without leaving the country. In fact without leaving the school! International Festival this year had a whole new twist. No more limiting ourselves to just one continent. ALACholics and friends were able to experience arts and crafts of different continents during the day and was able to move and participate in more physical activities in the afternoon for a whole week. Danke, 谢谢, Amesege'nallo', 감사합니다 for visiting our booths in Zen Garden and other venues for our other activities for this year’s International Festival. We hope you enjoyed the ride with us in Experiencing, Bridging and Celebrating Languages, Arts and Cultures.
Write ups by Chino Ong, Chan Uy, Barney Guia, and Mickey Depra!
Special thanks to our partner, The Confucius Institute!
