Well your tutors sure are! Last September 15, 2015, The Turuan Workshop was held in the SS Conference Room 1/2 to prepare the tutors for one semster of teaching. Mr. Patrick Capili was invited as a guest speaker who gave them some tips and tricks on how to make class even more enjoyable for you! Hope you're excited because class starts on September 28, 2015!!
