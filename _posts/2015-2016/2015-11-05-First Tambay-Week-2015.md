Great Scott! For the first time, two weeks were more than enough for our ALACholics to relieve themselves from an onslaught of requirements. We went back in time and with Elvis Presley’s help, we decided on a tropical atmosphere! Our ALACholics enjoyed the showing of iconic movies like The Breakfast Club. With card games and video games, they got to know other fellow members better. A colorful complimentary cornucopia of childhood snacks and drinks kept everyone's energy up. Mahalo for visiting us at MVP 315 for this semester’s Tambay Week!
